					<p>In the original draft of this scene, now in the possession of the Sheridans of Frampton Court, Dorchester, the person with whom Lady Sneerwell is conversing is a Miss Verjuice, and it is only later in the scene, after the entrance of Joseph Surface, that we find a reference to “Snake, the Scribbler.” In revising the scene, Sheridan found that one character might suffice for the minor dirty work of the plot; and to this character he gave the dialogue of Miss Verjuice and the name of Snake. The name Sneerwell is to be found in Fielding’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Pasquin</i>. <a href="act-1.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The reading of this epigram by Sir Benjamin Backbite is perhaps another of Sheridan’s reminiscences of Molière; at least there is a situation not unlike it in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Precieuses Ridicules</i>, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Femmes Savantes</i>, and in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Misanthrope</i>. In the final quarter of the eighteenth century, there arose a species of dandy called the macaroni, much as in the final quarter of the nineteenth century there arose a variety called the dude.</p>
					<p>“The Italians are extremely fond of a dish they call macaroni, composed of a kind of paste; and, as they consider this the <i xml:lang="la">summum bonuni</i> of all good eating, so they figuratively call everything they think elegant and uncommon <em>macaroni</em>. Our young travellers, who generally catch the follies of the countries they visit, judged that the title of <em>macaroni</em> was applicable to a <em>clever fellow</em>; and, accordingly, to distinguish themselves as such, they instituted a club under this denomination, the members of which were supposed to be the standards of <em>taste</em>. They make a most ridiculous figure, with hats of an inch in the brim, that do not cover, but lie upon, the head; with about two pounds of fictitious hair, formed into what is called a <em>club</em>, hanging down their shoulders, as white as a baker’s sack” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Pocketbook</i>, 1773, quoted in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T. L. O.</abbr> Davies’s “Supplementary Glossary”). The name of the macaroni is also preserved in the first stanza of our “Yankee Doodle,” which is almost contemporaneous with Sheridan’s play. <a href="act-2.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This scandal scene of Sheridan’s had predecessors in the comedies of Congreve and of Wycherley, not to go back as far as the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Misanthrope</i> of Molière. Hard and cruel as Sheridan’s scene now seems to us, it is gentle indeed when contrasted with the cudgel-play of Congreve and Wycherley. It is possible that Sheridan owed some of his comparative suavity to the example of Addison, who contributed to <abbr>No.</abbr> 17 of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Spectator</i>, a “Fine Lady’s Journal,” in which there is a passage of tittle-tattle more like Sheridan than Wycherley or Congreve. <a href="act-2.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In 1777 a committee of the House of Commons was appointed to inquire into the laws concerning usury and annuities; and on its report in May, the month in which this play was first acted, a bill was brought in and passed, providing that all contracts with minors for annuities shall be void, and that those procuring them and solicitors charging more than ten shillings <em>per cent</em> shall be subject to fine or imprisonment. <a href="act-3.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Sheridan has been accused, justly enough, of making his servants talk as their masters; but this is an old failing of writers of comedy, although few of them would have risked this accurate use of the legal phraseology which Sheridan at all times affected.

The music to Sheridan’s song was composed by his father-in-law, Thomas Linley, who had been his partner in <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">The Duenna</i>. <a href="act-3.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>An erring tradition authorizes Moses to interpolate freely and frequently throughout the rest of the scene a more or less meaningless “I’ll take my oath of that.” As the part of Moses is generally taken by the low comedian who also appears as Tony Lumpkin, this gag may be a reminiscence of the comic scene in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">She Stoops to Conquer</i>, in which Tony offers to swear to his mother’s assertion that Miss Hardcastle’s jewels have been stolen. <a href="act-3.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Victor Hugo was an assiduous follower of the English performances; and it may be that this scene of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">School for Scandal</i> suggested to him the scene with the portraits in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Hernani</i>. <a href="act-4.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
