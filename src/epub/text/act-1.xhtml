Now, on the face of these circumstances, it is utterly unaccountable to me, why you, the widow of a city knight, with a good jointure, should not close with the passion of a man of such character and expectations as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Surface; and more so why you should be so uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual attachment subsisting between his brother Charles and Maria.</td>

I am sneered at by all my acquaintance, and paragraphed in the newspapers.
